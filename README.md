# Resistor Color Code Calculator

This is an application of programming and web development skills to an electrical engineering problem (readiing of resistances based on color codes).

## Resistance Color Code
* 4 - Band Color Code Resistor
* 5 - Band Color Code Resistor
* 5 - Band Color Code Resistor

### 4 - Band Color Code Resistor
The 4 - band color code resistor has 4 bands and the bands represent the following:
- 1st Band: 
- 2nd Band:
- 3rd Band: Represents the 10 times multiplier of the band.
- 4th Band: This represents the tolerance levels of the resistor.
